## Basic features:
*	**Health Bars**: Each time player fails to reflect a ball, the health bar decreases in length. If the health reaches zero, the game is over.
*	**POW bars**: It allows the player to use Power Ups, such as Bubble Shields and Rainbow Shots. Each use of the Power Ups consumes a certain amount of POWs.
*	**Slippery Paddles**: Paddles do not stop immediately if the player stops pressing UP/Down buttons. The paddles decelerate and cushion in. This feature makes the paddles harder to control and challenges players to plan the moves ahead.
*	**The ball**: The ball will shoot from the centre with random color, size, speed and angle.
*	**Sound**: added sound effects and music (Enjoy it!).

## Advanced features:
*	**Bubble Shield**: Players can consume POWs to generate a bubble shield. It reflects the balls back.
*	**Rainbow Shot**: Players can consume POWs to activate the paddles into rainbow mode. Any ball hits a paddle with rainbow mode will be reflected and move at a doubled speed.
*	**Reflection**:  Balls will bounce back from each other.
*	**Exchange of Momentum**: If a rainbow ball hits a normal ball, they will exchange the momentum. Meaning the normal ball will become a rainbow ball and vice versa. 
*	**Particles**: A particle system is built in this game. If a ball hits the left or right boundary, it will explode and generate a particle cluster, like fireworks.
